## Cross-Agent Expectations

- Communicate breaking changes via `ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md` before landing them.
- Prefer additive changes; leave TODOs rather than deleting another agent’s work.
- Log blockers or ownership gaps in this file so the right agent can act.
- Default to feature branches and avoid force pushes on shared branches.
